This is a law to protect a person’s original work from being used by others without their permission.
Like artists, authors, and musicians who charge people for their work, computer scientists make a living from digital creations such as software.

The act allows anyone who creates something to claim and own the copyright for the work so that no-one can use it without paying for it, or asking them first. Only the creator has the right to make copies or perform it in public or give other people permission to do so.

Sometimes people try to copy the work illegally.  Copying software such as games and applications, scanning books, downloading images, music and video without permission means the creators, are not paid. 
This is stealing. It is illegal, and unethical.
The increased use of digital technology and the internet has made it easier to steal these items. 

Large corporations such as Apple, Google, Samsung and Oracle are continually battling in the courts claiming the others have infringed their copyright. 
Apple and Samsung have been fighting for years in the American courts over software and technology used in mobile phones and who owns the rights to features  such as ‘double-tap’ and ‘pinch to zoom’.
