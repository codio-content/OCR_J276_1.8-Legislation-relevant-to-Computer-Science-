Creative Commons is an organisation which provides licences that allow the creators to give the public permission to share and use their work under certain conditions.
They give people the right to share, use, and even modify a work that an artist, musician or writer has created without charge.
There are several levels including:

- **Public domain** – there are no restrictions. It can be used without permission or attribution for any purpose.
- **Attribution license** – the work can be used, distributed and copied as long as the creator is given credit for having created it.
- **Attribution-non-commercial license** – as above but only if it is used for non-commercial purposes.
