The Freedom of Information Act was set up to end a culture of secrecy in all forms of government. Before its introduction, the UK had no legislation obliging the public sector to make information available to the general public.

The act creates a right of access to information held by public authorities, which include central and local government, the health service, schools, colleges and universities, the police and courts.
The person requesting the information does not have to give a reason but the holder does if they refuse a request. The requester can then appeal to the Information Commissioner.

There have been many disclosures of information in the press enabled by the Freedom of Information Act, including, in May 2015, details of expense claims made by leading politician including the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Speaker of the House of Commons.
